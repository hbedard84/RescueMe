my name is Tyson and here are some things you need to know about me!&nbsp; After you read through my bio, if you think&nbsp;I might be the perfect pup for you, please go to www.allamericanmuttrescue.org\/forms and complete your adoption application online. I AM A SUPER SENIOR!&nbsp;\nTyson is&nbsp;still a clown!&nbsp; He still loves to run and play&nbsp;with his foster siblings, although he doesn't run as fast or play as long as in his younger days. His arthritis slows him down, but he hasn't become a total couch potato yet! Tyson does well with most&nbsp;other dogs&nbsp;IF they are properly introduced.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is OK having another pup around for company as long as they know how to chill. But he would be fine as an only pet with an owner who spends quality time with him. At the top of his wish list is a fenced yard where he can explore safely off-leash.&nbsp; He will be happiest with a family who will spend lots of time with him.Tyson is&nbsp;housebroken&nbsp;and crate trained although he really doesn&rsquo;t like staying in the crate.&nbsp; He has nice house manners and settles nicely when inside.&nbsp;He will do best with a loving&nbsp;family that will make him an important family member.&nbsp; He just needs a family who will love him and spend lots of time with him.\n&nbsp;\nApproximate age\/birthdate:&nbsp; ~ Feb 2009Weight\/size: 50 &ndash; 55 lbsHousebroken:&nbsp; YESCrate trained:&nbsp; YES but he is not thrilled about going into a cratePersonality:&nbsp;&nbsp;happy, playful, loving\n&nbsp;\nEnergy level:&nbsp; medium Fenced yard&nbsp;required?:&nbsp;&nbsp; YES .. he really enjoys spending time outside exploring\n&nbsp;\nDoes he\/she jump fences?&nbsp; NO\n&nbsp;\nLeash walk:&nbsp; YES Obedience training:&nbsp; Knows &lsquo;sit&rsquo; and &lsquo;off&rsquo;Riding in vehicles:&nbsp; RIDES OK but gets a little anxious at firstSpayed\/neutered:&nbsp;&nbsp; YESUp-to-date on routine vaccinations:&nbsp;&nbsp; YESMicrochipped:&nbsp;&nbsp; YESSocial with other dogs:&nbsp; YES when introduced properly&nbsp; ... may be a bit intimidating to very small dogs Social with cats:&nbsp; NO CATSGood with children: Hasn&rsquo;t been around children while in foster care but he would probably be fine with older children.&nbsp; Would probably not be a fan of loud, active&nbsp; younger children\n&nbsp;\nAdoption fee:&nbsp; $75\n&nbsp;\nWe are an all-volunteer group, so please be patient and understand that it takes an average of 7-14 days to process the applications including reference checks, follow-up questions and home visits.&nbsp; You can expedite the process by providing accurate email addresses for all your references.&nbsp; Time to make phone calls is limited and we often have 10 or more applications in process.&nbsp; We&nbsp;make every effort&nbsp;to move through them as quickly as possible.\n&nbsp;\nWhen your application is approved, we will schedule a meet-and-greet to see if Tyson picks you too. \nIf it seems that the adoption will be a good match for all, there is an adoption fee, and an adoption contract to be signed. \nPlease feel free to email weluvpups@hotmail.com&nbsp;if you have additional questions.

Select the dog that most interests you.\n\n2. Everyone in the household needs to spend some time interacting with the dog. If you already have a dog in your household, it is wise to bring your dog over to the Adoption Center to meet the dog you have selected.\n\n3. Fill out an adoption application form (note: filling out an application DOES NOT guarantee an adoption).\n\n4. An Adoption Counselor will review the application. Upon approval of the application, starting the following week around Tuesday, we will call to set up an appointment to visit your home to confirm that the fencing and gates are secure, and the yard is safe for the dog.\n\n5. No dog is ever adopted from the program without a home check.\n\n6. If more than one application is submitted for a given dog, our adoption committee will select the home that is best suited for the dog's needs.\n\n7. The entire adoption process can take up to one week.\n\n8. The adoption process is concluded when an Adoption Contract is completed and the non-refundable adoption fee is paid.\n\n9. Our non-refundable adoption fees per dog are\n\n$125 for senior dogs, 8 yrs. and up\n$175 for puppies under 4 mo.\n$150 for all other dogs\n\nIf you can increase the adoption fee for the dog you are adopting, please do so. Any amount over the adoption fee is tax-deductible. If you cannot, please remember us during the holiday gift giving season and for donations of dog toys, dog beds, blankets and other items all rescue groups need. But most importantly PLEASE remember to tell your friends who FALL IN LOVE with your dog (because they will) to ADOPT, don't breed or buy.","about":"Canine Adoption and Rescue League is an IRC 501(c) (3) Private Non-Profit No-Kill Organization.

Located in Huddleston, VA, we are truly in the heart of Virginia \u2013 30 minutes from Lynchburg, 30 minutes from Smith Mountain Lake, 30 minutes from Bedford, and 60 minutes from Roanoke.\n\nOur motto is \u201cRescue \u2026 rehome \u2026 real love\u201d and we try to live it every day.  We rescue animals in need of new homes and loving families.  We make sure each of them is spayed or neutered and up-to-date on all routine vaccinations.  If other medical care or treatment is needed, we get that for them as well.  \n\nWe welcome them into our homes and our lives and really get to know their personalities and their needs.  Then we make it our mission to re-home them \u2026 and to place them in the forever home that will be perfect for them.  Some of them really need to have another pup companion while others will do fine being an \u2018only pet.\u2019  Some love having children to play with while others prefer being with adult people.  Some do well sharing a home with cats or other small pets while others, well \u2026 not so much.  And the only way you know this is by living with them!  \n\nWe also work to educate and encourage pet owners to spay or neuter their animals to a) help their pets lead longer, healthier lives and b) help reduce the numbers of homeless and unwanted animals in our Central Virginia communities.  It is such an easy thing to do!  Not only will it benefit your pet and your family, but it will help reduce the numbers of wonderful, adoptable animals that are euthanized every year.  Please be part of the solution\n","services":"adoptions - all pets are spayed or neutered and up-to-date on
